# Main Idea
Add new habit:
1. I want to reduce: calories
2. I want to improve: sleep time
Not too cluttered. 
No target to be set. 

Display:
Journal should be displayed as bar chart.

Enter a number:
Clicking on the bar chart should popup the "enter data" modal.
Clicking the bar should display the drop-down. The width of the drop-down can be larger than the bar itself.

Compare the number:
Compare with previous history and judge whether improving/reducing or not. 
Option 1) Display status using traffic light colors.
Option 2) display color info in the bar chart itself
